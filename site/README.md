# Freelance Landing Page

This folder contains a simple, responsive landing page you can use to find clients.

Quick start:

1. Replace placeholder text and images in `index.html` with your own.
2. The contact form is set to send messages to `Parkgamesofficial@gmail.com` using FormSubmit.co. On first submission you'll receive a verification email — follow the link to enable delivery, or replace the form `action` with your preferred provider.
3. Host on GitHub Pages or Netlify: point the site to the `site/` folder or copy `index.html` to your repo root.

Notes:
- Use real testimonials and measurable results to increase trust.
- Add tracking (Google Analytics or Plausible) and a simple CTA to book a call (Calendly) for better lead flow.
